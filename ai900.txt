The read model, layout model, and general document model do not identify and extract common data fields.

-Face identification in the Azure AI Face service can address one-to-many matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Face verification has the capability for one-to-one matching of a face in an image to a single face from a secure repository or a photo to verify whether they are the same individual. Face attributes, the find similar faces operation, and Azure AI Custom Vision do not verify the identity of a face.

-Vectorization captures semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space.

-Multiple linear regression models a relationship between two or more features and a single label. Linear regression uses a single feature. Logistic regression is a type of classification model, which returns either a Boolean value or a categorical decision.\

-Classification algorithms are used to predict a predefined category to which an input value belongs.

-Classification is used to predict categories of data. It can predict which category or class an item of data belongs to. In this example, sentiment analysis can be carried out on the Twitter posts with a numeric value applied to the posts to identify and classify positive or negative sentiment.
